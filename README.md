# Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree Portfolio

Personal implementation of projects in the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation course (August 2017).

Check out the folders to see the various projects implemented in Python using iPython (Jupyter) notebooks, along with some commentary in the corresponding README.md files.

# Personal Reflection

This is my first time paying for an online course, and I am impressed at how well this Udacity course was organized. The videos were on point and explained concepts at a reasonable pace. What I like about this kind of format is that it allows me to learn at a pace that is comfortable for me (I usually like it _fast_. I completed the six month course in one month).

The only downside to a traditional classroom setting is that feedback is not as dynamic. Yes, we do have a Slack channel that have administrators that supply prompt responses, it still not as efficient in answering questions as personal conversation is. As I am a very independent learner who only occasionally needs to ask clarifying questions, this does not bother me that much, thankfully.

The entire reason why I chose this course (and went to college) is to make sure I am learning the right concepts, in the right order, and in a manner that I will retain that information. I have found that it can be tremendously difficult for me to motivate myself towards an open-ended goal (e.g., "Let's learn about deep learning."). But provide me a curriculum and a tiny bit of feedback, and it is off to the races. I need _some_ semblance of external motivation, and then I am set.
